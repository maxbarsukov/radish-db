defmodule RadishDB.Raft.StateMachine.Statable do
  @moduledoc """
  A behaviour that defines data to be replicated by RadishDB's Raft nodes.

  It is required to implement a callback module of this behaviour to run a consensus group.
  Concrete implementations of all callback functions of this behaviour must be
  [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), so that all members of a consensus group
  can reproduce the data by replicating only `command_arg`.
  Therefore, for example, if you want to use "current time" in your command implementation,
  you must not obtain current time in `command/1` implementation; you have to pass it by embedding in `command_arg`.
  This is a design decision made to support arbitrary data structure while keeping Raft logs compact.
